# Label Studio Enhancement TODO

This is a roadmap/todo list for adding extra features to Label Studio CE. Each section outlines the function, feasibility, and potential implementation approach.

---

## 1. Dynamic Adjustable ML-Backend Parameters

**Goal:** Allow changing ML backend parameters on-the-fly without restarting the backend.

* Features:

  * Adjust confidence thresholds dynamically.
  * Swap model versions in real-time.
  * Change batch size and other model config.

* Implementation Ideas:

  * Hot-reload models in memory.
  * Expose `/update-config` API endpoint.
  * Use a config file or ModelManager class.

* Feasibility: Moderate

* Priority: High

---

## 2. Event Logger / Multi-Version Annotation History

**Goal:** Keep track of every annotation event, including re-labels, for auditing and recovery.

* Features:

  * Track per-user annotation history.
  * Detect re-labels and store previous versions.
  * Optional UI feed for recent activity.
  * Webhook-based or backend logging.

* Implementation Ideas:

  * Django signals for backend logging.
  * Webhook server to store events in JSON/database.
  * Admin page or lightweight React component for UI feed.

* Feasibility: Moderate

* Priority: High

---

## 3. Semantic Expand / Auto Edge Detection

**Goal:** Enhance labeling efficiency by automatically refining masks or polygons.

* Features:

  * User draws rough mask → ML backend auto-refines.
  * Integration with models like T-Rex2 (segmentation networks).

* Implementation Ideas:

  * Custom ML backend for segmentation.
  * Frontend integration to update labels in real-time.
  * Possibly add a new widget for polygon refinement.

* Feasibility: High complexity

* Priority: Medium

---

## 4. GPU Resource Preview & Training Monitoring

**Goal:** Provide annotators or admins with real-time feedback on GPU usage and model training status.

* Features:

  * GPU utilization, VRAM usage on Linux server.
  * Monitor ongoing training progress.
  * Possibly trigger dynamic training from Label Studio.

* Implementation Ideas:

  * Use Python libraries (nvidia-smi, PyTorch/TensorFlow) to fetch metrics.
  * Expose metrics via REST API.
  * React frontend dashboard for visualization.
  * Dynamic training triggers through backend API.

* Feasibility: Very high complexity

* Priority: Low/experimental

---

### Notes:

* Start with #1 (dynamic ML parameters) and #2 (event logger) for maximum ROI.
* \#3 and #4 are ambitious, consider prototyping separately before integrating.
* Combine webhooks + scheduled snapshots for safety and auditing.
